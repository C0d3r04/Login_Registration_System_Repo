This system works entirely on the terminal. 
Register as a new user if not already registered.
Make sure you answer the safety questions in case you forget your password.
Then go to the login page again and insert the username and password to login into the system.
There is an option to exit the interface if you want to.
In case you forget your password, select the "Forgot Password" option and answer the security questions to obtain your password.

Thank you for your time:)
